note are below but first ill address why came looking amazon for case anyone else happens seeking what wa ive been using this stuff the chef who introduced ha used over once stopped buying off him when hed get case bought middle eastern store the brand wa for long time simply into european because that the importer down glendale wadi one their brand and that the brand they attached this particular product for retail use whereas restaurant seem get bulk case the into european branded one seeing this one had hunch would the same their website made almost certain last bottle wa about third the way down and ive been using lot lately decided browse amazon and here that quirky octagonal romance ajar vessel with the superior quality foil label and gold aluminum lid glad looked online before calling around tried both side side and it definitely the same geographic source distributor texture thickness and taste label excepted what little confused the size here the store which guessing just amazon error figure worth it listed being what cataloged the site and the store and what own for brand dont surprised your bottle while two label differ how they express content one say net weight which would per tablespoon the other just say ounce the volume fluid ounce regardless into european the parent company wadi have plenty other stuff them too and most are quite yummy you suddenly cant find this into european brand you can always check their site see they streamlined into another line while star and review title should say enough about opinion saw some curiosity over the use this stuff here are some thought experience most frequent though not quite checklist below use for lamb instead mint like lamb stuffed with cherry and the like get local super fresh sustainable lamb cut liking the butcher and immediately take Ziploc freezer bag and shove herb aplenty sprig thyme being something never omit Meyer lemon peel and some the juice and often few slice too sometimes maille coarse whole grain mustard the whole nothing like yellow even brown Dijon really wine vinegar from italy and sometimes local honey wine vinegar some vanilla extract with bit the bean scraping home made and really mood dependent the rest often raspberry balsamic vinegar benessimo making nice clean cheap one sometimes grade vermont maple syrup drizzled sometimes unsulfured uwharrie all quirky mix spice also changing often content and proportion always let marinade least hour this vinegary mix that essentially slush and trim all the fat off the lamb before marinating using the fat separately and cooking this often come into play ill have whatever some kind they werent sometimes balsamic depending how much vinegar and what kind vinegar used the marinade condiment quality aged balsamic isnt sour like youd expect and matter what go with the lamb it never lot acid just enough make the fruit and savory flavor bold and binding and matter how cook lately the stove right with the fruit the end this get drizzled often when the pot slicing the lamb into leave medium rare blackberry make gorgeous and strawberry bring it sweetness out ive noticed the sour cherry chukar the pew arent sour all while preference get intense type already use local kind they often are made more tart with this this zing like tart cherry should when stuff lamb with the all depends the baking project and light zigzaggy drizzle this make nice crusty top when after getting almost temp broil very briefly anything high quality balsamic raspberry balsamic can too can this it also great for zinging sweet bland thing ice cream topping check salad dressing base check and it already thicker than vinegar base and seed bug you raspberry vinaigrette this can sub nicely you tone down the vinegar touch making tart actually tart check same with energy bar with those kind pitiful dried raisin type thing always unsweetened check swirling into fruit smoothy that arent quite strong you wanted check pretty homemade pop component that freezing doesnt make too weak check helping sad dehydrated fruit seem like it fresher than actual when cooking with them check adding fruity one lemonade stuff you buy blue blackberry syrup for even some tea with either hibiscus fruit that you wish had those thing check cold fruiting cheap glogg gluhwein that youre heating hopefully with lot whole spice the bottom the pot and some golden raisin the mug check being the spice spice powder for certain recipe possible check candying almond and other nut with light dusting spice and sugar the outside check candying those nut sans spice and bringing fantastic surprise dessert they get used big check using with savory warm herb and bit merlot for simmering then duck breast lord yes check and golden star for job well done finally while potentially not kosher making your lover taste even more delectable check please\n",
