didnt find all that jazzy have admit that when first tried this one wasnt crazy about seemed lacking flavor and richness compared green mountain french roast decaff which favorite have had several cup now and figuring out how brew for taste brew the ounce size cup and then add little cream and sugar and it perfect not terribly complex structure but not bad just different lighter variety have tried brewing the smaller cup serving and didnt seem make difference taste fullness think will just keep this one for what reliable lighter variety for day when feel like worth keeping

sriracha discovered this tasty condiment the asian food section the grocery store maybe wa the rooster the front the bottle the word sriracha dont know but ha now replaced tobacco and red hot staple hot sauce like how it more like paste the thickness make more user friendly burger and fry it more flavorful too and not too spicy opinion it excellent just about anything made some awful bland chickpea burger doused them with some sriracha and then added some zesty bread and butter pickle sound weird but telling you this stuff can make anything taste awesome looking forward actually trying something asian think would great seafood anyhow this stuff rock

full medium roast espresso bean espresso bean can roasted different way lavazza and illy represent the best two different approach roasting bean for italian espresso illy roast their bean for longer time but lower temperature than lavazza result it higher roasting temperature the lavazza darker and according some people more robust than illy it best when properly ground tamped and brewed lavazza espresso bit stronger tasting and also little bit more bitter than illy the lavazza espresso also ha very pure black color once brewed and when done properly ha hint licorice the aftertaste personally though prefer the illy approach which why giving this coffee four rather than five star but even certainly recognize the high quality lavazza opinion lavazza represents the very best the widely available dark opposed medium like illy italian espresso roast

awesome these tablet are the best brand have tried far and they work very well the tablet itself doe not taste bad and the effect last about half hour with constant eating probably longer you are not eating much definitely recommend cutting your food beforehand while you are waiting for the pill dissolve take about minute the four people who had try this all them felt very profound effect some favorite lemon juice and water taste like really good lemonade still pretty sour but still delicious not white grapefruit this taste like sex cider vinegar just sip still very strong but worth trying mango not work very well juice taste really good still slightly sour but like lemon drop candy put everything everything eating ton citrus short period time may give you stomach ache acid reflux the run death totally worth

label changed but hurrah found favorite quirky ingredient what pomegranate molasses some probably wonder the case this one concentrated pomegranate juice someone asked comment year back tasting note are below but first ill address why came looking amazon for case anyone else happens seeking what wa ive been using this stuff the chef who introduced ha used over once stopped buying off him when hed get case bought middle eastern store the brand wa for long time simply into european because that the importer down glendale wadi one their brand and that the brand they attached this particular product for retail use whereas restaurant seem get bulk case the into european branded one seeing this one had hunch would the same their website made almost certain last bottle wa about third the way down and ive been using lot lately decided browse amazon and here that quirky octagonal romance ajar vessel with the superior quality foil label and gold aluminum lid glad looked online before calling around tried both side side and it definitely the same geographic source distributor texture thickness and taste label excepted what little confused the size here the store which guessing just amazon error figure worth it listed being what cataloged the site and the store and what own for brand dont surprised your bottle while two label differ how they express content one say net weight which would per tablespoon the other just say ounce the volume fluid ounce regardless into european the parent company wadi have plenty other stuff them too and most are quite yummy you suddenly cant find this into european brand you can always check their site see they streamlined into another line while star and review title should say enough about opinion saw some curiosity over the use this stuff here are some thought experience most frequent though not quite checklist below use for lamb instead mint like lamb stuffed with cherry and the like get local super fresh sustainable lamb cut liking the butcher and immediately take Ziploc freezer bag and shove herb aplenty sprig thyme being something never omit Meyer lemon peel and some the juice and often few slice too sometimes maille coarse whole grain mustard the whole nothing like yellow even brown Dijon really wine vinegar from italy and sometimes local honey wine vinegar some vanilla extract with bit the bean scraping home made and really mood dependent the rest often raspberry balsamic vinegar benessimo making nice clean cheap one sometimes grade vermont maple syrup drizzled sometimes unsulfured uwharrie all quirky mix spice also changing often content and proportion always let marinade least hour this vinegary mix that essentially slush and trim all the fat off the lamb before marinating using the fat separately and cooking this often come into play ill have whatever some kind they werent sometimes balsamic depending how much vinegar and what kind vinegar used the marinade condiment quality aged balsamic isnt sour like youd expect and matter what go with the lamb it never lot acid just enough make the fruit and savory flavor bold and binding and matter how cook lately the stove right with the fruit the end this get drizzled often when the pot slicing the lamb into leave medium rare blackberry make gorgeous and strawberry bring it sweetness out ive noticed the sour cherry chukar the pew arent sour all while preference get intense type already use local kind they often are made more tart with this this zing like tart cherry should when stuff lamb with the all depends the baking project and light zigzaggy drizzle this make nice crusty top when after getting almost temp broil very briefly anything high quality balsamic raspberry balsamic can too can this it also great for zinging sweet bland thing ice cream topping check salad dressing base check and it already thicker than vinegar base and seed bug you raspberry vinaigrette this can sub nicely you tone down the vinegar touch making tart actually tart check same with energy bar with those kind pitiful dried raisin type thing always unsweetened check swirling into fruit smoothy that arent quite strong you wanted check pretty homemade pop component that freezing doesnt make too weak check helping sad dehydrated fruit seem like it fresher than actual when cooking with them check adding fruity one lemonade stuff you buy blue blackberry syrup for even some tea with either hibiscus fruit that you wish had those thing check cold fruiting cheap glogg gluhwein that youre heating hopefully with lot whole spice the bottom the pot and some golden raisin the mug check being the spice spice powder for certain recipe possible check candying almond and other nut with light dusting spice and sugar the outside check candying those nut sans spice and bringing fantastic surprise dessert they get used big check using with savory warm herb and bit merlot for simmering then duck breast lord yes check and golden star for job well done finally while potentially not kosher making your lover taste even more delectable check please

neat and cheap alternative espresso capsule although wa bit skeptical first got say these are pretty neat because you can fill with your own coffee and it also one time use cartridge for about pop you coffee cap shop one word and select the cheapest shipping capsule plus shipping espresso ha very tight grip the distribution their capsule but slight design change these allows them work with the espresso machine while still not infringing their copyright there are alternative this product which are called and another referred only brown black coffeeduck coffeeduck refillable coffee capsule for espresso pod the espresso cup fit all espresso machine from after october please make sure you have the correct machine before purchasing havent tried these myself they are bit more expensive and from what ive read other review and have seen YouTube they didnt just didnt seem the best choice for you may want online and look the amazon review these product judge yourself also look like the brown one which are out stock are the one for espresso machine made prior october the black one still available here are for machine after have the old original concept machine model from just aside ive also seen video people simply used espresso pod and the foil piece with new piece aluminum foil tried this once and the result were really crappy and watery and coffee ground ended machine anyway back fill with own espresso grind illy lavazza and ive got say that the coffee wa good and had decent cream theyre pretty easy use well although you might need experiment bit with the coffee grind and amount you put into the capsule ensure you get nice rich cup coffee take out new capsule using your pod the scoop scoop the very top and then simply wipe off the excess filled the top but not overflowing the rim then very carefully peel off the paper ring from the top the cup uncovering the sticky ring the top the cap and then place the aluminum cap top the capsule seal the coffee you need somewhat careful when youre peeling off the paper from the cup expose the sticky seal else you also remove the sticky seal which supposed stay the cup although the sticky seal for these capsule not the same the espresso air tight seal which think only done keep their packaged coffee fresh the seal good enough perform the job and prevent coffee from exploding outside the capsule know their video show them tamping down the coffee pod they fill them but for tamping work best and it simpler after experimenting bit noticed that you want the richer coffee and thick cream you should stick with darker roasted robusta bean finely ground espresso fine grind check out lavazza cream gusto ground coffee italian brick pack which primarily robusta and sale with subscribe and save and when tamping down the coffee dont pack too much before attaching the foil top else you just get little dribble coffee coming out and all honesty ive been using these capsule for some time but every once awhile this still happens the drink fine just take awhile longer fill the cup along with the illy brand coffee cafe pico cafe bustle lavazza cream and pilon also very good job these capsule you want see how much coffee espresso us their capsule you can also open new espresso capsule and see what the grind look like and the amount coffee they use you get idea too cheap that wouldnt recommend making these cup too far advance since you dont have airtight seal once you make the cup but instead make them when youre ready use them that day although this may seem bit work youre rush and remember you have buy your own coffee sort fun experiment with the different blend you can use any full half decaff coffee for those last minute guest that want espresso without all the caffeine you can experiment and add flavoring like vanilla spice etc

2 - some seed like produts but overlap is there\\
3- soups 4- bread cakes\\
5 -dog related\\
6 - some cereal produts\\
7 - misc produts\\
8 - pasta and noodle based\\
9 -candys and some junk food\\
\#\#\#\#\#\# avg Word2Vec: There is so much overlap in many groups and
not able to divide by product types. because of Word similarity avg
vectors some reviews are overlapping. some of them i find 0 - Misc
products but maximum contains good ratings\\
1- Candies chocolates\\
2 - oil/seed related\\
3- Misc products so much overlap but maximum contains bad ratings\\
4- Coffe/tea related\\
5 - max dog related\\
\#\#\#\#\#\# Tf-Idf Weighted Word2vec: i find there is so much overlap
in the clusters and tried with 3 clusters, and checked for positive and

cat candy you buy one tin buy ten because your cat will think these are wildly delicious strangely enough they are shaped like fish but they contain ingredient like green tea extract and rosemary oil went through one tin week and cat thought these were the best treat they had ever tasted had idea cat would enjoy rosemary oil cat treat nor did think they would paw the empty tin begging for buy more definitely treat hide safe place even after taking these out the packaging and box cat were clawing the box get more you have hide the box high place drawer they will find way get into the container ll not sure who enjoys these treat more love seeing how much two cat enjoy these treat the tin with two treat can also work training tool because the cat will instantly respond when they hear the treat being shaken the tin Rebecca review

B000162MSG

good but not really dark chocolate kind nut spice dark chocolate nut sea salt bar are tasty snack but labeling them dark chocolate misleading they are basically bar walnut almond peanut and rice krispies glued together with honey and chocolate while tasty the main problem the chocolate really wouldnt call dark certainly did not taste like dark chocolate otherwise it pretty good low sodium low sugar sugar alcohol artificial sweetener gluten and transfer free say other than the chocolate not being that dark these bar are one tasty snack
